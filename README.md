I only have 20h playtime, so I do not have much text or story translated.
The regexes and substitutions should be used sparingly, I only wrote them for what I assume appear the most or change often, to reduce duplicate clutter.
If any are actually not useful, you can remove them to improve performance.

Refer to https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator for more details.
